Summary: This game is a subway surfers-like game but with skiing. The user’s skier will be able to be customized by the user’s choice of helmet, skis, boots, and goggles. Mountains and runs based off of real-world locations

Theme: Cartoon theme without realistic graphics. 3rd Person viewing mode.


Design:
    Home Screen - all buttons will be colored with those that match with the background
        Customization - In the middle of the screen is your customizable skier as a 3D model, spinning slowly to show off its customization.
            When you click on the skier, it brings the user to a new page to customize

        Stats - Above the skier, it shows some stats: most coins collected, and longest time played

        Play - Under the skier, will be an “Play button” that brings the user into the game.

        Settings - In the top right of the screen, there will be a settings button with a basic options menu with things like volume sliders and sensitivity sliders

        Background - The background of the home screen will be a detailed ski slope, with jumps, trees, and other skiers skiing down in the background

        Leaderboard - On the left hand side of the screen, there will be a leaderboard for stars completed.

    Cosmetics page
        Layout - This page will have the user’s skier in the middle, just a bit smaller.
        You will be able to click on any customizable part of the skier (boots, skis, googles, and helmet) which will bring a dropdown menu of all cosmetics for that part.

        Spin Wheel - To unlock cosmetics, there will be a wheel to spin on the right side of the screen and you will randomly get a cosmetic for any part
                To spin the wheel, it will cost a star (earned by completing runs) and then you will get a new cosmetic and will not be greyed out in the dropdown menu for that part
                When the cosmetic is equipped, the skier in the middle will change based on that cosmetic 

    End Screen
        After you lose, the end screen will show your time in the middle, amt of coins collected right under, a play again button, and a back to home button. The background of this screen will be your skier, either crashed into a rock, skier, tree (the way you lost).

Gameplay
    After clicking play, a cut-scene will play, showing your skier getting off a chair lift, and head toward the slope, then you can start playing once it reaches the slope

    The movement should be fluid with the user being adn to change direction with ease and speed up and brake without a jerk of the screen.
        Changing direction wont move the skier 90 degrees right or left, but will gradually point them in the directions they want to move

    Controls
        Computer: A and D for side to side movement. Space bar for jump. R to do a trick

        Mobile: swipe side to side to move directions. There will be a button on the side to do a trick.
    
    Obstacles - On runs, there will be obstacles
        Other skers/snowboarders going down the mountain (not multiplayer, just npcs)
            If hit them, you will lose;

        Rocks, trees, and holes will be other obstacles
            Slightly Hitting an obstacle will slow down the user a lot and a dizzy animation will play.

            Completely ramming into it will make you lose


        Hitting an obstacle will slow down the user a lot and a dizzy animation will play.
        Technique Req - Some levels and run(the more difficult ones) will require certain movement techniques to be able to get down the mountain quick enough.
            Harder levels will also have more obstacles

        On more steep slopes, the user may lose control of their character bc their technique wasnt right and have to restart the level

    Coins
        There will be coins on the slope, able to be collected.

    Jumps
        There will be small and big jumps the skier can go on for extra coins

    Routes
        The movement will be free (unlike how subway surfers have 3 columns). The obstacles will be randomly placed too, allowing creative movements and stuff

        There will also be extra routes, like through trees, or side routes that lead to other parts of the mountains that the skier can go through. 
            These routes may have more obstacles or may be easier, still unsure

    FUNCTION OF SLOPE 
        You are facing down the slope as you play (3rd person)
        
        The mountain/slope is infinite, like as you go down, more ski slope will appear (ask me if you have a question abt this)
        
        As you increase through the game, you speed will increase and more obstacles will appear faster, making it more difficult to survive.
