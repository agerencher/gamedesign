Snowboard / Ski Game
This game will feature multiple mini-games and story modes (with more to come).

1. Basic Story Mode
Mountain Selection

Players start with a set of mountains to choose from, all modeled after real-world locations.
## creative feature
Some mountains are locked initially, as they require more advanced skills to access.
## Is there some sort of criteria for having more advanced skills? You might want to make this more clear that once you finsih the levels you progress. 
## Also, is there any sort of difficulty that icnreases as the mountains progress? What will change as the mountain progress? Will more jumps be included? Will the user get faster? How will the levels get more difficult if they are?
Run Selection

Once a mountain is selected, players can choose from various runs across the mountain.
The interface will zoom in on the mountain, focusing on different runs.
## I'm a bit confused how to visualize this. First off, would this be first person or third person viewing mode? Also, what does it mean that it will zoom in on the mountain? Is this once the game starts or a way to choose a run? This seems like a cool feature, but just needs to be more fleshed out.
Players must start with easier runs (bunny slopes and greens), each acting as its own level.
## nice way of progressing through the runs and levling up. Suggestion: Make sure the game isn't progressing at to slow a pace. I don't want to do bunny runs for a while.
Run Mechanics


Players are rated with 1-3 stars based on:
Time to complete the run
Number of other skiers/snowboarders hit
Number of obstacles hit
Jumps may be included but do not yield extra benefits.
Earning at least 1 star unlocks the next run, and completing all runs on a mountain unlocks the next mountain.
## Suggestion: I would suggest having it so that you have to earn a certain amount of stars to get to the next mountain. If you just have it so that they have to finish the levels, unless their is somethng inherently hard about the game, the game will be much too easy. 
End Screen

After each run, the end screen will display:
Stars earned (centered)
Time for the run (below stars)
## need some sort of a reward system. I would recommend a coin system where you get coins for completing levels. You can then use coins to buy gear + possibly attributes.
Buttons:
Play Again
Next Run (or Back to Map if it's the last run on the mountain)
Back to Map
The background of this screen shows the skier celebrating at the finish line or falling in the snow if the player lost.
## smart to include this
2. Game Theme and Interface
Theme Colors

Inspired by snowy mountains: shades of blue, white, and some green.
Home Screen

Background features a mountain with a 3D, animated skier slowly spinning in the center.
Character Customization:
Click on the skier to customize your character with different clothes, skis, helmets, etc.
Customizations are unlocked by earning stars.
## Might want to use coins for this
Stars allow players to spin a reward wheel (located at the bottom of the screen with a "Spin for Reward" text).
## what is in this reward wheel? Is all of the customizations of your character unlocked through a random wheel? You might want to allow the user to choose their own stuff.
User Stats and Navigation

Above the skier: the number of runs successfully completed.
Below the skier: an Explore button (displayed in a cartoonish rectangle box) to access the map of mountains.
## What does above and below the skier mean? Is this during the run? Is this on the homescreen?
Buttons and graphics blend with the snowy background, using colors that complement the winter theme.
## How do I play the game? Is it using the keybaord? Is it a mobile game. A game using the keys could be fun but you would still have to decide how to make the game more difficult? What is to stop the user from completing the level? Obstacles? Holes? Some sort of difficulty in the actual action of skiing?
## How realistic will this game be? Will it be modern, futuristic, etc.? Be more speific about your theme.
## How do the characters move? Not only how will the user control the character, but will they go in an S shape down the mountain? Will they just turn hard right when you press the right key?
